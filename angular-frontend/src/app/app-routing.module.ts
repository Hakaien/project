/**
 * app-routing.module.ts
 * --------------------
 * This file is intentionally left empty.
 *
 * This project uses Angular's standalone/bootstrap API with `provideRouter`
 * (see `src/main.ts` and `src/app/app.config.ts`) and defines routes in
 * `src/app/app.routes.ts`. The routing is therefore provided at the
 * application bootstrap level instead of through an NgModule-based
 * `AppRoutingModule`.
 *
 * Keep this file if you prefer to keep the generated artifact, or remove it
 * if you want to clean up unused files. If you later migrate back to the
 * NgModule-style routing, you can re-create the module here and import
 * `RouterModule.forRoot(...)` as needed.
 */

// Intentionally no exports; routing is configured via `provideRouter` in main.ts
